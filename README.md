MoeSocket
=========

A lightweight proxy which base on twisted

Be carefully:  
    This project is to be built to practise twisted 
    and I was guided by this [blog](http://ioctl.eu/blog/2011/03/10/twisted-socks5-server).In fact all of the codes are similiar to it.And I will try more to implement a good socket proxy.
